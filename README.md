Scientific Calculator 


This project is a menu-driven scientific calculator developed in C as a console-based application. It is designed to perform both basic arithmetic and advanced scientific calculations while demonstrating structured programming, use of mathematical libraries, and file handling in C. The calculator also includes ANS memory and a persistent calculation history feature. 

Features 

Basic Arithmetic Operations 

Addition of two numbers 
Subtraction of two numbers 
Multiplication of multiple numbers 
Division with proper division-by-zero validation 
Scientific Calculations 

Square root 
Power function (xʸ) 
Trigonometric functions: 
Sine (degrees) 
Cosine (degrees) 
Tangent (degrees) 
Natural logarithm (base e) 
Factorial calculation 
Quadratic equation solver 
Memory and History 

Stores the most recent result using ANS 
Automatically saves each calculation to history.txt 
Allows users to view past calculations across program executions 
Option to clear calculation history when required 
How to Use 

Compile and run the program 
Select an operation from the menu by entering its number 
Provide the required input values 
View results instantly and reuse the last answer using ANS 
Exit the program safely using the exit option 
Requirements 

A C compiler (GCC, Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or similar) 
Any major operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) 
Basic knowledge of C programming 
File Handling 

history.txt stores all calculation results 
The history file remains available even after restarting the program 
Users can clear the file contents using the Clear History option 
Limitations 

Factorial values may overflow for large inputs 
Trigonometric functions may return large values near undefined angles 
Complex roots in quadratic equations are indicated but not calculated 
Purpose 

This project is suitable for academic use, beginner-to-intermediate C learners, and as a demonstration of console-based application development in C.
